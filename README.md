This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/expo/create-react-native-app)

### Available Scripts

If Yarn was installed when the project was initialized, then dependencies will have been installed via Yarn, and you should probably use it to run these commands as well. Unlike dependency installation, command running syntax is identical for Yarn and NPM at the time of this writing.

### Expo Client
Download Expo App from Google Play Store or App Store.

### Node.js
It is preferably to install Node.js 10.20 version as it a more stable.

### How to Run
1. Install expo-cli. 
   - NPM: npm install -g expo-cli
   - Yarn: yarn global add expo-cli
2. Run npm install.
3. Run expo start --no-dev.
4. Scan the QR Code with Expo Client.
