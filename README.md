This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/expo/create-react-native-app)

### Available Scripts

If Yarn was installed when the project was initialized, then dependencies will have been installed via Yarn, and you should probably use it to run these commands as well. Unlike dependency installation, command running syntax is identical for Yarn and NPM at the time of this writing.

### How to Run

### `expo start`
To run the command, expo-cli is needed to be installed. The Expo app is also needed to be downloaded from Google Play or App Store.

Runs the app in production mode.

Open it in the [Expo app](https://expo.io) on your phone to view it.
